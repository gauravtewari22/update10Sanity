<h1>About This Project</h1>
<p>The purpose of sample projects generally is to provide you with a working 
 project so that you can see how it all hangs together. In this particular 
 project, the content also provides you with a straightforward explanation 
 of the main features of <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>. 
 </p>
<p>It is less detailed than Adobe&#39;s own online help but the aim is to get 
 you going quickly. For many users that will be sufficient leaving the 
 online help for the more detailed issues.</p>
<p>When you generate outputs from this project, this topic will not appear 
 using the condition expression that it ships with - Not Exclude.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Should you make changes that 
 you cannot reverse, you can easily get a fresh copy. <br/>
Delete the broken copy that is in My RoboHelp Projects and grab a fresh 
 copy from Program Files. Don&#39;t attempt to open it from there, it will 
 not function properly.<br/>
