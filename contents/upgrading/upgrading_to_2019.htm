<h1>Upgrading to <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span></h1>
<p>There are big changes to the code in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 as it is HTML5 and CSS3 based. Projects created in earlier versions will 
 not be truly upgraded in the normal sense, instead your old project is 
 left untouched and a copy is made on the fly. It is that copy that is 
 upgraded. That means that you retain your project in its old format by 
 way of a backup.<br/>
</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/images/tip.gif" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> You are nonetheless recommended 
 to retain a backup copy in either source control and/or a zipped copy. 
 <br/>
A zipped copy prevents you opening it accidentally and working on it before 
 you realise it was the backup. Also you always have a clean backup that 
 can be used to create a new clean copy time after time. Prefixing the 
 zip file with the date is good practice. YYMMDD_MyProject.zip.</p>
<h2>Converting the Project to <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 Format</h2>
<p>When you are ready to convert your project created in any earlier version 
 of RoboHelp, then on the Starter Page click Upgrade Project or Click File 
 &gt; Upgrade RoboHelp Classic Project and browse to the main folder of 
 your existing project.</p>
<p>Click Open to display the New Project dialog.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/new_project_dialog.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Complete as required and click Create.<br/>
</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> When you upgrade, all the image, 
 media and CSS files will be moved from their existing locations into the 
 &quot;assets&quot; folder you see below. The folder structure of your 
 project will be retained for folders containing such files. <br/>
For example, if you had all your images in a folder named Images and your 
 media files in a folder named Media, in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 you will see Assets &gt; Images and Assets &gt; Media. Wherever they are 
 pre-upgrade, the structure will be mirrored within Assets.<br/>
After the upgrade, it&#39;s up to you where you save the assets but using the 
 Assets folder is recommended.</p>
<p>In most cases that will work fine no matter what version you are upgrading 
 from. If you do encounter any issues, try opening you project in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> Classic first 
 and then upgrade that to the new <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<h2>The Upgrade</h2>
<p>In <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 your project will look like this. You will see the same folders as before 
 but with the addition of the &quot;assets&quot; folder.</p>
<p class="Caption"><img src="../assets/images/images/contents_01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/><br/>
</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> RoboHelp 2019 lets you change 
 folder and file names in File Explorer and it will be immediately reflected 
 in RoboHelp. The change will show as soon as you put focus back on RoboHelp. 
 Careful, though, it can break links.</p>
