<h1>Single Sourcing Using Condition Tags</h1>
<p>Single sourcing is a method of applying condition tags to topics, content 
 in topics, toc books and pages and index entries so that the tag can be 
 included in a condition expression to exclude it from a chosen output. 
 For example, a single topic could contain additional information only 
 to be seen in certain outputs, perhaps a printed output needs an image 
 not required in online versions. Essentially it means a single project 
 (source) can produce multiple outputs, each with different content. This 
 is done by using Condition Tags.</p>
<h2>How do Condition Tags Work?</h2>
<p>The concept is best explained using an example. Let&#39;s say you are producing 
 a knowledge base for your company with some content that applies to everyone, 
 some applies only US readers, some only applies to UK readers and some 
 only applies to Canadian readers. Also end users must not see each others 
 content. In that scenario <a href="../outputs/dynamic_content.htm">Dynamic 
 Content Filtering</a> would not work as they could all see the content 
 for the others. You need to generate separate outputs for each group.</p>
<p>In this example you would create three condition tags labelled US, UK 
 and Canada.</p>
<p>The screenshot shows the default condition tag groups. You can edit 
 their names and add or remove the groups in Project Settings.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/tags01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/></p>
<p>Here though Audience suits our purposes so click the + icon, select 
 the group in the dropdown that displays and set the color for it.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> When you set the color for any 
 tag, also set the opacity to low so that the text is still legible.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/tags02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/><br/>
With the required tags set up, you now create your content. Here paragraphs 
 have been set up with content for a specific audience.</p>
<p>Simply select the text to which the condition tag is to be applied, 
 right click and select Apply Condition Tags.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/tags03.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>In the Preview you can select specific tags to see the effect of using 
 the tags.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> In Preview you select a tag 
 to include its content. Keep in mind that when you generate your output, 
 the expression you create there could reverse that.</p>
<p>You can also set a condition at topic level in the Properties </p>
<h2>Using Condition Tags in an Expression</h2>
<p>In Output &gt; Output Settings, click Condition Expressions, then click 
 the + icon to create an expression.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/tags04.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p>As you drag tags, by default <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 will set the tag to be excluded and additional tags will be set to be 
 AND.</p>
<p>Thus if you drag both UK and Canada, by default the expression will 
 be Exclude UK AND Exclude Canada so the output will exclude anything that 
 has the UK or Canada condition tag applied. It will include content that 
 has no tags or other tags.</p>
<p>For other purposes, you can easily change Exclude to Include and you 
 can change AND to OR.</p>
<h2>Generating an Output</h2>
<p>By using different expressions, you can generate different outputs for 
 different audiences, such as in the example above, or you could apply 
 the Print condition tag to images and then exclude the images from online 
 help but include them in Printed Documentation and so on.</p>
<p>In the Output Presets you can either select the required expression 
 each time you generate or you can create one or more presets and set each 
 one up with a specific expression. In this example you might set up Responsive 
 HTML5 US, Responsive HTML5 UK and Responsive HTML5 Canada.</p>
