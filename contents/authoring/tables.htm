<h1>Tables</h1>
<p>Adding tables has been improved since the initial release of <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> and now provides 
 many formatting options.</p>
<h2>Creating a Table Style</h2>
<p>In the screenshot below, a table has been added to a topic using the 
 Insert Table icon in the standard toolbar but the CSS used for the topic 
 does not have a table defined.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/tables01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Click the + icon to create a table style.</p>
<p>Select table as the tag and enter your name for the table class to be 
 created, in this example it is blue_border.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/tables02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>The default Properties will then be displayed.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/tables03.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Defining the Table Style</h2>
<p>It is very important to note what has been selected in the Apply Formatting 
 To dropdown and Whole Table is often misunderstood. </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p>Generally anything you set here with Whole Table selected will 
	 apply to all the cells in the table with the exception of the border. 
	 Here Whole Table means the outer borders of the table, not the individual 
	 cells.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you change the dropdown to one of the other options shown, 
	 then the formatting will apply only to whatever you have selected.<br/>
	<br/>
	<img src="../assets/images/images/tables04.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to experiment a little to get what you want but you will 
 soon find it is simpler than it may appear.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Try setting up fonts and shading 
 with Whole Table selected and then select from the dropdown shown above 
 any exceptions. Maybe you want all cells to have one color as the background 
 but the First Row to have another color. Set the first color with Whole 
 Table selected, then select First Row and select the second color.</p>
<h2>Defining the Borders</h2>
<p>Easy when you know how!</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say this table is to have a 1pt wide border around all cells and 
 a 2pt border the same color around the outer edges.</p>
<p>In the Cell settings blue has been defined to apply to all cells and 
 the same color has been set in the Border Settings but with a width of 
 2 pts.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/tables05.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p>Here&#39;s that table back in the topic.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/tables06.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Different Formatting in Columns, Rows or Cells</h2>
<p>No matter how well you design your table in the editor, there will often 
 be occasions when a particular column, row or cell need something different.</p>
<p>You can apply an overriding style from Properties &gt; Styles to individual 
 cells. It will be possible to apply an overriding style to rows and/or 
 columns in a later update.</p>
<h2>Table Header</h2>
<p><span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 can be set up to use the TH style to give proper table headers. This is 
 important for accessibility compliance.</p>
