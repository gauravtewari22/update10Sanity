<h1>Images, Videos and Captivate</h1>
<p>Inserting Images, Video and Captivate outputs couldn&#39;t be simpler.</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>Click in your topic where the image is to appear, then click the image 
 icon on the authoring toolbar, browse your Project Files or Local Files 
 or paste a link to the image and click insert.</p>
<p>You can also just drag the file from the Contents Panel into your topic.</p>
<p>Most image formats are supported including SVG and Google&#39;s WebP format. 
 Click the file type dropdown in Project Files or Local Files to see the 
 full list.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/images_02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/><br/>
You will see a preview, just click Insert.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/images_01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p>You can position the image, add a border and so on by clicking the image 
 and going to Properties.</p>
<p>On import, the size of the image will be its true physical size. You 
 can change the size it displays at in the topic by changing the dimensions 
 in the fields shown below. That does not change the true image size allowing 
 you to show the image at different sizes in different topics if required.</p>
<p>If you tick the Thumbnail check box, two further fields will be displayed. 
 There you can define the size of the thumbnail as it will appear in Preview 
 and your online outputs. In Printed Documentation, it will be the same 
 size as when you are in Author mode.<br/>

<h3>Image Maps</h3>
<p>Image maps can be used for many things. For example, they can be a great 
 way of providing help for a software screen. </p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p>Create an image of the screen and add it to a topic as described 
	 above.</p></li>
	<li><p>Select the image and an additional icon will appear in the toolbar. 
	 <br/>
	<img src="../assets/images/images/map_icon.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_Only" border="0"/></p></li>
	<li><p>Click the icon to display the mapping dialog. Select the shape 
	 you want, rectangle, circle or polygon.<br/>
	<span style="font-style: italic;">Rectangle</span> - Click the rectangle 
	 icon and drag from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner. <br/>
	<span style="font-style: italic;">Circle</span> - Click the circle 
	 icon and drag to create the circle. <br/>
	<span style="font-style: italic;">Polygon</span> - Click the polygon 
	 icon and click where it is to start. Drag to the next point and click 
	 again. Repeat until you have the shape you want and double click the 
	 final point to stop drawing.<br/>
	If any mapped areas need to overlap, use the four toolbar icons on 
	 the right to set the priority.<br/>
	<img src="../assets/images/images/image_map_01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_Only" border="0"/></p></li>
	<li><p>When you have finished creating your shapes or after you create 
	 each shape, select the area and click the Link icon to display this 
	 dialog.<br/>
	<img src="../assets/images/images/image_map_linking.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_Only" border="0"/></p></li>
	<li><p>To change the link target, double click the focus area and link 
	 to the new target.</p></li>
	<li><p>To change the map shape, select the shape and click the dustbin 
	 icon.</p></li>
	<li><p>To change the map size, select the shape and use the drag icons.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The process for videos is the same as for images.</p>
<p>Click in your topic where the video is to appear, then click the Insert 
 Multimedia icon on the authoring toolbar, browse your Project Files or 
 Local Files or paste a link to the video and click insert.</p>
<p>You can also just drag the file from the Contents Panel into your topic.</p>
<p>Most video formats are supported. Click the file type dropdown in Project 
 Files or Local Files to see the full list.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/media_02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p>You will see a preview that you then insert.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/media_01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p>Click Insert. At a basic level, that&#39;s it. </p>
<p>You can position the video, add a border and so on by clicking the video 
 and going to Properties.</p>
<h2>Captivate</h2>
<p>Click File &gt; Import &gt; Adobe Captivate Demo and browse to the demo 
 you want to insert. You can browse to the CPZ or ZIP file created by Captivate 
 or the HTM/HTML file that launches your demo. <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 will take what it needs and the demo will show in the Contents Panel.</p>
<p>Click the Insert Multimedia icon and click Adobe Captivate Demo, then 
 browse to the demo you imported.</p>
<p>You can also just drag the file from the Contents Panel into your topic.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/captivate_demo.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p>Click Insert. That&#39;s it!</p>
<p>You can position the demo, add a border and so on by clicking the demo 
 and going to Properties.</p>
