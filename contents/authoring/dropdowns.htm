<h1>Dropdowns and Expanding Text</h1>
<p>Dropdown text and Expanding text are useful ways of entering additional 
 information that is not needed for all readers. This could be extra information 
 for novices or information for experts that is not needed by the general 
 reader.</p>
<h2>Creating Dropdowns and Expanding Text</h2>
<p>Dropdowns and Expanding Text are created using these icons on the standard 
 toolbar.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/authoring_toolbar.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/></p>
<p>Select some text and click one of the icons.</p>
<p>The selected text will be the hotspot and the editing area will display 
 as shown.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/dropdown_01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/></p>
<p>Add your content as required and format it in the same way you would 
 any other content in the topic.</p>
<p>When you have finished entering the content, you can hide it by simply 
 double clicking the hotspot. Double click again to view or make further 
 edits.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> You can now have different text 
 for the dropdown or expanding text hotspot when it is closed and when 
 it is open. Create the dropdown or expanding text with a string such as 
 Click to see more, then go to Properties &gt; General &gt; Close Text 
 and enter a string such as Close to hide.</p>
<h2>Preview</h2>
<p>In Preview, you will see options to show or hide all dropdown and expanding 
 text.</p>
<h2>Twisties</h2>
<p>Both dropdowns and expanding text can have &quot;twisty&quot; images 
 applied.</p>
<h3>Creating the Twisty Style</h3>
<p>Double click the CSS file to open the editor and select the dropspot 
 style. Expand the Twisties dropdown and enter the path for the images. 
 If you need more than one style of twisty, simply create duplicates such 
 as a.dropspot2.</p>
<h3>Applying the Twisty Style</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/twisty01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0" /></p>
<p>Select your dropdown or expanding text hotspot and go to Properties 
 &gt; Styles and select the required dropspot style. You can check it is 
 set up correctly in Preview.</p>
<h3>Expand/Collapse All</h3>
<p>The skins now include an Expand/Collapse (Show/Hide) All icon.</p>
