<h1>Word and FrameMaker Docs</h1>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Both Importing and Linking have 
 been greatly simplified.</p>
<h2>Importing Word Documents</h2>
<p>Click File &gt; Import or right click in the Contents Panel and browse 
 to the document you want to import to start the process.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> You don&#39;t have to have any version 
 of Word installed on your computer. You can import any Word document created 
 in Word 2013 or higher and saved in DOCX format.</p>
<p>Initially use the default.wsf (Word Settings File) and browse to the 
 document to be imported. As soon as you have selected the document, in 
 the bottom right corner of the window you will see <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 reads the document after which you can proceed with the other settings.</p>
<h3>General Settings</h3>
<p>Select the CSS file to be used for mapping and select the style to be 
 used as the break point if you want separate topics based on a style. 
 </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> If you use one CSS file for 
 your topics, automapping (described below) works best if you use that 
 CSS file here.</p>
<p>Set the Topic Name Pattern if you want something other than the default.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/word_general.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<h3>Automapping</h3>
<p>Before looking at the remaining settings, you need to understand how 
 automapping works. <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 attempts to automap styles where it can match the name in the Word document 
 with a style in the CSS defined for style mapping. Against each style 
 in Character, Paragraph and Table settings you will see how the styles 
 have been mapped.</p>
<p>You then have the option to change any of the mappings by clicking the 
 dropdowns.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/word_mapping.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Using the dropdowns, you can change the styles that automapping has 
 applied.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>If any styles cannot be mapped because they are unique to the 
	 Word document, the Mapped Style dropdown will allow you choose Import 
	 Style, Discard Style or Map to Style.</p></li>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Discard Style maps any style in Word, including headings, 
		 to the &lt;p&gt; tag in the CSS used for style mapping. </p></li>
		<li><p>Import Style will create the style in a second CSS with 
		 the name in the format &lt;word_doc_name.css&gt;.</p></li>
		<li><p>Under Map to Style, you will see the styles defined in your 
		 CSS.</p></li>
		<li><p>There is also an option to map to Pre to format text that 
		 looks like code.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<li><p>A new Discard Content option allows you to discard any content 
	 with the selected Word style.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The styles that can be mapped will be applied in the topic(s) created 
 and will use the definitions in the style mapping CSS that will be linked 
 to the topic. Going forward, any changes to your CSS would then be applied 
 to the mapped styles in the imported topic(s) in the same way as 
 all other topics. </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> If you have styles in Word and 
 want to change them in RoboHelp <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> 
 importing, add a style to your CSS with a name such as Reformat and set 
 the font for that with a garish color. Then map those styles to Reformat. 
 After the import you can go through the topic(s) created and apply different 
 styles as required. The garish color will make them easy to find.</p>
<h3>Character Settings</h3>
<p>Here you set the Mapped Style settings in Automapping above as required.<br/>
</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Word documents retain many styles 
 that are not used in the document, especially documents that have been 
 worked on by many people. Previously all the styles would have appeared 
 here for mapping. In <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 only the styles in use will appear.</p>
<p>Here there are no character styles in the CSS and the desired result 
 is to use the &lt;p&gt; tag in RoboHelp. That is what will happen using 
 Discard Style.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/word_character.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<h3>Paragraph Settings</h3>
<p>Here you set the Mapped Style settings in Automapping above as required.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Word documents retain many styles 
 that are not used in the document, especially documents that have been 
 worked on by many people. Previously all the style would have appeared 
 here for mapping. In <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 only the styles in use will appear.</p>
<p>Here <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 has automapped Heading 1, Heading 2 and Normal. CSSTest has not been found 
 in the CSS file used for style mapping so Import Word Style has been suggested. 
 You can either select a style from the dropdown or apply Discard Style 
 when any paragraph in the Word document will be set to &lt;p&gt; in your 
 topic.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/word_paragraph.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<h3>Table Settings</h3>
<p>Any tables in your Word document can be mapped to table styles defined 
 in your CSS.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/word_table.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h3>Advanced Settings</h3>
<p>In most cases the settings below will work best.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/word_advanced.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>With updates applied, you will see all the above settings.</p>
<ul class="Standard_Bullet">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>In most cases it is best to select the 
	 Convert Word Lists to HTML Lists check box.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>If you select Add Topics to Table of 
	 Contents, you will be able to create a new TOC or add to an existing 
	 TOC. A page will be created in the TOC for each topic created on import.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>Supplied scripts or your own scripts 
	 can be set to run automatically after import.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Saving Your Settings</h2>
<p>Before you click Import, if you have made any changes to the settings 
 that you want to use again, click Save Settings. Each time you import, 
 the last WSF file saved will appear but you can choose any other configuration 
 you have saved.</p>
<h2>Linking Word Documents</h2>
<p>Simply right click in the Contents Panel and select Link &gt; Link File 
 and browse to any DOCX file.</p>
<p>When the DOCX file is displayed in the Contents Panel, hover over it 
 and select Create Topic(s) in the Options menu and your topic(s) 
 will be created. The settings for the linked document will be the wsf 
 file defined in Project Settings.</p>
<p>There is a menu option Edit Settings as below. Click that to change 
 the settings that will be applied to the default wsf file as defined in 
 Project Settings.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/link01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h2>FrameMaker Documents</h2>
<p>FrameMaker import and linking is included with <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>. 
 You need FrameMaker 2019 Update 3. It works in broadly the same way as 
 Word described above.</p>
