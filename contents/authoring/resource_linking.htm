<h1>Resource Linking</h1>
<p>Resource Linking replaces the Resource Manager that was in earlier versions. 
 It does much the same job and provides a means of accessing various files 
 such as images that are maintained by another part of the author&#39;s organization 
 and are liable to change. </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> When you upgrade a project, 
 any resources being used will be brought into your new project and be 
 linked. You will need to create links as below to any folders and files 
 that were not in use at the time of the upgrade.</p>
<h2>Linking Folders and Files</h2>
<p>Simply right click in the Contents Panel and click Link &gt; Link File 
 or Link Folder and browse to what you want to see in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>. 
 In this image a folder has been added.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/resource_linking.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Just drag any image into any topic as required. </p>
<p>Whilst the arrow remains green, you know what you are using is in sync 
 with the source. If it appears red, then the source has changed but your 
 topic will not automatically update. It may be the source has been changed 
 in preparation for say a new corporate image but for now you want to continue 
 using the old version, that&#39;s OK. When you are ready to use the updated 
 image, click the menu icon that displays while hovering over an image 
 and click Sync.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> After you have linked a folder, 
 you may see many resources that you know you will never want. You can 
 delete those from here. Hover over the image and click Delete in the menu.</p>
<p class="Spacer"> </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> What you see in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> is a snapshot 
 of the files at the time the folder was added to <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>. 
 New files added to the source folder later will not be shown but any you 
 need can be added. </p>
<p class="Spacer"> </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Do not rename any folder or 
 file in either the source location or <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 as that will break the linking.</p>
