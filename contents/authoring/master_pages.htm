<h1>Master Pages</h1>
<h2>What Are Master Pages?</h2>
<p>If you want certain information to appear as a header or footer in your 
 topics, you can use master pages to save you creating that content in 
 every topic. This can include standard text and various placeholders for 
 features such as breadcrumbs.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/>  <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 ships with an optimized PDF master page for use with Printed Documentation. 
 It is explained in <a href="../outputs/outputs_word.htm">Printed 
 Documentation Output</a>.</p>
<h2>How Do I Set Up Master Pages?</h2>
<p>Click the Master Page icon in the Project Toolbar and then click the 
 + icon alongside Master Pages in the Project Component Panel. Enter a 
 name for the master page in the dialog that appears and then your master 
 page opens ready to be set up.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/master_pages_01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Additional icons will be displayed in the standard toolbar above. These 
 allow you to switch between editing the header and footer and to insert 
 various placeholders such as breadcrumbs. Hover over each one to see what 
 it does.</p>
<p>You can enter text in the header and/or footer in the usual way and 
 you can format it in the Properties panel.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> If you only use one master page 
 and want it applied to all topics, you don&#39;t have to apply it to each 
 one. When you generate an output there is an option to apply a master 
 page in the settings. <br/>
If you have set a different master page for any topic, the master page 
 in the preset will override that. That can be useful in some scenarios.</p>
<h2>Style Sheets - CSS</h2>
<p>When creating a master page you can apply a CSS style sheet to it. When 
 you generate an output, the hierarchy will be:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p>Where topics have master pages applied but no master page is 
	 defined in the preset, the CSS of the master page(s) set in the topics 
	 will apply. If there are topics without a master page defined, they 
	 will display using their own CSS.</p></li>
	<li><p>Where a master page is defined in a preset, that will override 
	 the CSS of both the topics and the master page(s) applied to them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>To add breadcrumbs to a master page, place the cursor where you want 
 the breadcrumbs to be positioned and click the breadcrumb icon on the 
 toolbar.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/breadcrumbs_icon.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>To format the breadcrumbs click in the breadcrumbs in the master page 
 and go to Properties. Check the type is &quot;Breadcrumbs&quot; and edit 
 as required in the General settings.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>You can open a Master Page to edit its properties or you can right click 
 the master page in the Master Page Panel to see its Properties without 
 opening it.</p>
