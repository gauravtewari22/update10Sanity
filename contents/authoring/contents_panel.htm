<h1>The Contents Panel</h1>
<p>The Contents Panel shows all the topics in the project, rather like 
 Project Manager in older versions of <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>.</p>
<p>With a topic open, the Properties Panel shows the properties and allows 
 editing.</p>
<ul class="Standard_Bullet">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">General 
	 </span>displays the properties of whatever is selected.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Styles</span> 
	 displays the styles in the selected CSS</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Topic</span> 
	 displays to topic properties.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Working in the Contents Panel</h2>
<p>This is rather like Project Files in Project Manager as seen in RoboHelp 
 Classic versions but there is a big difference. In Classic versions anything 
 that was in Project Manager went into your output unless excluded by an 
 expression. Now what goes into an output is controlled by the Table of 
 Contents used. How that works is described in <a href="contents_panel.htm">The 
 Table of Contents</a>.</p>
<p>What you will see here is an assets folder along with whatever structure 
 you create for topics.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/contents_01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p>If you look at the project in File Explorer, you will see the 
	 structure is different. The root folder contains the rhpj file that 
	 opens the project. This replaces the XPJ file from earlier versions 
	 and there is no longer a CPD file.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p>Your files are in the Contents folder where you will also find 
	 the Assets folder. All the other folders are for the <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> internal files.</p></li>
	<li><p>You may also see JSON files in your project. These are files 
	 used by <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>. 
	 Don&#39;t touch! </p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Assets folder is new. The idea is to keep your images, CSS and suchlike 
 separate from your topics with their own organizational structure.</p>
<p>Right click any folder or file and you will see the various options 
 available, similar to previous versions.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> When you upgrade, all the image, 
 media and CSS files will be moved from their existing locations into the 
 &quot;assets&quot; folder you see below. The folder structure of your 
 project will be retained for folders containing such files. <br/>
For example, if you had all your images in a folder named Images and your 
 media files in a folder named Media, in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 you will see Assets &gt; Images and Assets &gt; Media. Wherever they are 
 pre-upgrade, the structure will be mirrored within Assets.<br/>
After the upgrade, it&#39;s up to you where you save the assets but using the 
 Assets folder is recommended.</p>
<p>When you open a topic that is in the Contents Panel, the content appears 
 alongside with its properties in the Properties Panel. See <a href="working_on_topics.htm">Working 
 on Topics</a></p>
<h2>The Contents Panel Context Menus</h2>
<p>In the Contents Panel the context menu changes according to whether 
 you have focus on a folder, a file or a blank area.</p>
<h3>Blank Area</h3>
<p>Blank Area means anywhere below or to the left of the list of contents. 
 </p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/context01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> There&#39;s a great new feature 
 here - Import Folder. Click that and you can then browse to any available 
 drive and select a whole folder of, for example, images or you can browse 
 and select multiple images and add them in one go. The same option is 
 in the Folder context menu.<br/>
Don&#39;t confuse this with Resource Linking, it&#39;s an alternative way of adding 
 to the pool of resources without having links.</p>
<h3>Folder Menu</h3>
<p>Right click on any folder to see this context menu.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/context02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Expand will expand the folder with focus and all of its sub-folders. 
 </p>
<h3>File Menu</h3>
<p>The options will vary according to the file type selected. The menu 
 shown below is for topics.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/context03.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>The context menu has various options including Locate in Topic in a 
 TOC and Show in Explorer to see the topic File Explorer.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> If the Locate in TOC option 
 does not show, it is because the topic is not in any TOC. That&#39;s a useful 
 way of checking.</p>
