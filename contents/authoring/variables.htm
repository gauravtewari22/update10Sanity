<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>Variables allow you to enter a string that can be inserted in topics, 
 topic titles, master pages, snippets, index entries and a table of contents. 
 They are used where the string could change in the future. Company and 
 product names are good examples. Instead of having to edit every place 
 the company or product name is used, you insert a variable. When the value 
 of that variable changes, you change it once and it cascades to wherever 
 you have used it.</p>
<p>Another scenario is where you need to change the string in different 
 outputs. For example, you might want one output for your US customers, 
 one for your UK customers and one for your Canadian customers. You can 
 create Variable Sets to create different outputs.</p>
<h2>Adding a Variable</h2>
<p>To add a variable, click the + icon and enter the name and default value 
 for the variable. To edit or delete it, click the menu that appears when 
 you hover over the variable. You can also double click to edit.</p>
<p>The name of the variable no longer has to include an underscore.</p>
<p class="Caption"><img src="../assets/images/images/variables01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>To use the variable, just drag it to where you want in the topic or 
 press CTRL + 1 to display a dialog with the variables listed.</p>
<p>To add a variable to the Title of an Output, place the cursor where 
 you want the variable press CTRL + 1 to display the dialog.</p>
<h2>Formatting Variables</h2>
<p>If you enter a simple string into the variable, it will take on the 
 format of the paragraph it is in. In the Warning - Normal variable shown 
 below which does not have any inline styling in its value, it has taken 
 on the normal paragraph style. You can apply any style or class to a particular 
 instance of the variable.</p>
<p>In the Warning - Red variable inline styling has been applied so the 
 variable will always show &quot;Warning&quot; in red. Again you can also 
 apply a style or class to a particular instance of the variable.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Warning - Red has to be written 
 as you see it below. If you are not sure what HTML is required for your 
 variable, create it in a topic, switch to code view and copy/paste it 
 from there.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/variables03.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>In your output it will look like this.</p>

<h2>Variable Sets</h2>
<p>Having created your variables with their default values, the next stage 
 is to create the values that will vary.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say the default values are for US users, in Output mode you click 
 Variable Sets and click the + icon to create say UK Values. All the variables 
 you have created will be listed and you can apply the UK values.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/variables02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p>Repeat the process for all the sets you require.</p>
<p>Later if you tick the check boxes, a Reset button allows you to revert 
 any or all the values to the default values so that you can start again.</p>
<p>The Sets are selected when you configure an output. </p>
