<h1>The Table of Contents</h1>
<p>This topic covers the full Table of Contents. See <a href="../bits_and_pieces/bits_and_pieces.htm">Bits 
 and Pieces</a> for in topic Mini TOCs.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Now you can automatically keep 
 your TOC page titles in sync with your topic titles. See below.</p>
<h2>The TOC Controls Your Outputs</h2>
<p>There is a big change in what goes into an output in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>. In earlier versions, 
 an output contained everything that was in Project Manager that was not 
 excluded by the build expression. In <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 it is controlled by the table of contents.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Every 
 topic that you want in the output must be in the TOC or have a link from 
 a topic that is in the TOC.</span></p>
<p>You may not want users to see a TOC with every topic that can be accessed, 
 some you may just want to be links from other topics. Not every topic 
 has to be included in the TOC. </p>
<ul class="Standard_Bullet">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>Topics with links from other topics 
	 or the index will be included whether or not they are in the TOC.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>Topics that you do not want users to 
	 see in the TOC and that do not have links from other topics or the 
	 index must be included. There is a check box to hide such items in 
	 the TOC that the user sees. Baggage files are included in this way 
	 as described below.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s say you have a topic that has links to say twenty others that 
 give supplementary information. Only that one topic needs to be in the 
 TOC as the links will automatically pull in the twenty supplementary topics. 
 That does not prevent you from including any or all of the twenty, it&#39;s 
 just that you don&#39;t have to.</p>
<h2>Baggage Files</h2>
<p>Because the TOC controls what goes into an output, you also use it to 
 add baggage files to the output. Baggage files are files you want in the 
 build when you generate but that are not referenced anywhere.</p>
<p>When you click Insert Pages while editing a TOC, as shown below in Adding 
 Items to the TOC, there will be an option Local Files. Select the baggage 
 file you want to add and it will be uploaded when you generate. If you 
 don&#39;t want the baggage file to appear in the TOC, just tick Hide in Output 
 in the Properties panel.</p>
<h2>Using the TOC</h2>
<p>Click Table of Contents in the Project Toolbar. If you have multiple 
 TOCs, when you expand one of them, the others are temporarily hidden so 
 that you can focus on the open TOC. As soon as you collapse a TOC, the 
 others will be displayed again.</p>
<p>You can work on the TOC in the TOC pane or you can open it in the authoring 
 area.</p>
<p>You can duplicate an existing TOC as the base for a new TOC and you 
 can copy/cut/ paste items between TOCs.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Editing 
 the TOC in the TOC pane on the left and editing in the authoring area 
 have an important difference. <br/>
</span>- In the TOC panel any changes made there are autosaved and you 
 will see the changes mirrored in the authoring area if you also have the 
 TOC open there. There are two ways to reverse any changes made in the 
 TOC pane. The quickest way if you have made many changes is to click in 
 the panel and keep using CTRL Z until you get back to where you want to 
 be. You can also right click and use the Undo and Redo options in the 
 context menu.<br/>
- In the authoring area changes are not autosaved. As you make changes, 
 an asterisk will display in the tab to show there are unsaved changes. 
 The changes will only show in the TOC panel when you save the changes.</p>
<h3>Working in the TOC Pane</h3>
<p>Click the twisty to see the contents of the menu and right click any 
 item to see the editing options.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/toc_01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/><br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/toc_02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<h3>Working in the Authoring Area</h3>
<p>If you prefer to edit in the authoring area, contract the menu using 
 the twisty that is on the left in an expanded menu. Hover over the menu 
 to see a menu icon and select Edit or double click the TOC name.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/toc_02b.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/toc_03.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/></p>
<p><br/>
The TOC will open in the authoring area to the right and the standard toolbar 
 will display the necessary options. The TOC Properties will be displayed 
 in the Right Panel.</p>
<h2>Adding Items to the TOC</h2>
<p>Click New Page to display this dialog.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/toc_insert.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p>Note the options. You can add Project Files, Local Files outside your 
 project (Baggage Files), links to Web Pages and create draft emails for 
 your users.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Creating emails is new. The 
 title will appear in the TOC. Clicking that page will open the email in 
 the users default email program.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/email.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h2>TOC Page Titles In Sync With Topic Titles</h2>
<p>When you add a topic to your TOC it defaults to using the topic title. 
 Change the topic title and the TOC will automatically sync with the new 
 title. This will not override a page title you enter into the TOC.</p>
<h6>How does this work?</h6>
<p>Within the <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 internal files, the page title is left empty by default. If you do not 
 manually enter a string <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 will display the TOC title as the page title. </p>
<p>When you generate an output, RoboHelp will check the internal file to 
 see if the TOC page title is empty and if it is, it will use the topic 
 title. If you have entered a string though, that will take priority and 
 be used.</p>
<h6>I entered a string but now I want the two in sync.</h6>
<p>In the TOC, delete what you entered and click Apply.</p>
<h6>Does this work in projects upgraded from earlier versions?</h6>
<p>Yes. During the upgrade <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 compares the TOC page title with the topic title. If they are the same, 
 internally the TOC page title will be empty and work the same way as in 
 a new project. If they differ, the TOC page title will use your original 
 title.</p>
<h2>Broken Links</h2>
<p>Red Xs will show against any item in the TOC where the link is broken.</p>
