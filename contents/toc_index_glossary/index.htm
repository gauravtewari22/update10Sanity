<h1>The Index</h1>
<p><span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 has one index that is used for all outputs. The keywords are now stored 
 in the topics so the keywords seen by the user will only be those related 
 to the topics in the build. You can apply conditional tags to a keyword 
 so that a topic can be included but with certain keywords excluded.</p>
<p>Click the keyword icon in the project toolbar (shown here with the names 
 extended) and click the + icon to add keyword, which can include variables, 
 then right click a keyword to add topics. An error message will appear 
 if you attempt to add an existing keyword.<br/>

<p>When you right click a keyword, you will see these options.<br/>
<img src="../assets/images/images/index_02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p>You can apply a Condition Tag to exclude a keyword from a particular 
 output.</p>
<p>You can also see the keywords in the topic properties and add/delete 
 there. As you type, any existing keywords that match will be shown to 
 avoid creating duplicates.<br/>

<p>You can delete a keyword here and enter new keywords. Type in the new 
 keyword and press Enter.<br/>
</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Being able to add index entries 
 here with the topic alongside makes it very easy to read through a topic 
 and add the keywords you think will help. You don&#39;t have to worry about 
 duplicating a keyword, if it&#39;s already in the index, the topic will automatically 
 get added to the existing keyword.<br/>
</p>
<p class="Spacer"> </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> The index keywords will also 
 be shown in search results.</p>
<p class="Spacer"> </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> You can drag an index keyword 
 to any location in a topic so that when the user is taken to that location 
 rather than just seeing the topic opened. You can also create keywords 
 that link to bookmarks to achieve the same result.</p>
<h2>Cross Referencing</h2>
<p>Sometimes you want several keywords to reference the same topics. To 
 save you adding the same topics to multiple keywords, you can just add 
 the topics to one keyword, then add a cross reference from the other keywords. 
 Right click a keyword, select Add Cross Reference and browse to the keyword 
 that already has the pages added. </p>
