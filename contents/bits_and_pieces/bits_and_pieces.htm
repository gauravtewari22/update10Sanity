<p>This is the home for those little bits and pieces of information that 
 don&#39;t warrant a topic of their own but are still important.</p>
<h2>Auto Save</h2>
<p>In Preferences you can now set an Auto Save interval.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/autosave.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p><span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 will auto save at the specified interval. Whilst the topic remains open 
 in the authoring area, you can use Undo/Redo or CTRL Z/CTRL Y through 
 all the autosaves made in that session. Once the topic is closed, the 
 changes are committed.</p>
<p>You can also use Undo/Redo or CTRL Z/CTRL Y with Auto Save deselected 
 whilst a topic is open even though you have saved.</p>
<p>In all cases, once you have closed the topic, the undo options are no 
 longer available.</p>
<h2>Colors</h2>
<p>Colors can be set for fonts, borders, backgrounds and so on, anywhere 
 you see this option.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/color01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Click the highlighted area to display the swatch shown below in a new 
 project. In a project upgraded from a Classic version you will see the 
 colors that were defined in that project.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/color02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Use the sliders to adjust or set a color. As you do so, the RGB and 
 hex values will change. Use the A (alpha) setting to adjust the opacity 
 of the color.</p>
<p>Alternatively, click and release the eye dropper, then move the mouse 
 to select whatever color is picked up by the cross hairs. These will be 
 surrounded by a large circle displaying the color that will be defined 
 when you click again.</p>
<p>New colors can be added to the swatch from Project Settings.</p>
<p>To close the swatch dialog, click outside the area or press the Escape 
 key.</p>
<h2>File Association</h2>
<p>You can associate various file types with your preferred editor.</p>
<p>Click Edit &gt; Preferences and then File Association.</p>
<p>Enter the file extension and then browse the exe file of your preferred 
 editor, then click the + icon to see that in the row below.</p>
<p>Click Done when you have added the required editors.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/file_assoc_01.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
<p>When you add a link in a topic using the Link icon, you can add a screen 
 tip to give the user more information. If you drag topics to create a 
 link in another topic, right click the link to add the screen tip.</p>
<p>Right click a hyperlink to edit it or open the target.</p>
<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>With each update more and more keyboard shortcuts are being added. See 
 the <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 online help for the current shortcuts. <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/robohelp/using/keyboard-shortcuts.html" target="_blank">Click here.</a></p>
<h2>Language File</h2>
<p>The LNG file as it was originally known allowed you to make many changes 
 to terms the end user sees. Later it was renamed Labels but it was still 
 deep in the Project Settings. Now Labels are easily found in Output Presets.</p>
<p>Hover over an existing set to edit or delete it. </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Now you can import and export 
 sets between projects. Great news for anyone who works with multiple languages 
 as that can save on costs.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/labels.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Markdown</h2>
<p>Import options include the import of markdown files.</p>
<h2>Mini TOCs</h2>
<p>In your longer topics, you can add a mini TOC that lists the headings 
 in that topic. This topic shows a mini toc. You can also insert a mini 
 TOC into a <a href="../authoring/master_pages.htm">Master Page</a>.</p>
<p>Place the cursor where you want the mini TOC and click the icon shown.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/top_toolbar_minitoc.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/></p>
<p><br/>
In the author view it will look like this with some formatting applied. 
 In this example, it has been set to show up to six levels of heading. 
 The heading shows here as Mini TOC (placeholder) but in preview it will 
 show whatever you set in Properties.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/minitoc_source.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>In the preview, it will look like this.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/minitoc_output.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h3>Formatting the Mini TOC Caption</h3>
<p>Click in the placeholder line and go to Properties. Here you can define 
 the caption users will see, with different captions dependent on whether 
 the list is expanded or contracted if you choose that option. You can 
 also change the font by selecting a style from your CSS or applying inline 
 formatting.</p>
<h3>Formatting the Mini TOC Links</h3>
<p>To change the default appearance of the list of topics, click next to 
 list and go to Properties &gt; Styles &gt; Lists.</p>
<p>Select one of your pre-existing list styles or create a new one with 
 a name such as minitoc-list-item to clearly identify its purpose. To change 
 the appearance of that list style, click the pencil icon alongside to 
 open the CSS editor. Set the appearance for each level.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> At the moment, you can only 
 apply one font style, color, size and weight to the whole list.</p>
<h2>Multiple Columns</h2>
<p>Content can be created in multiple columns.</p>
<p>Click any style in the CSS editor and you will see a new group, Multiple 
 Columns. You can set that for the body tag so that all content is in the 
 number of columns you set or you can set it for specific styles. That 
 would allow you to have, for example, a heading that is full width but 
 the styles set for the content to be display in two columns.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/multiple_cols.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Paragraph Markers</h2>
<p>Technically &quot;pilcrows&quot;. If you want to see your paragraph 
 markers, go to View &gt; Show &gt; Paragraph Markers to toggle them on 
 or off.</p>
<h2>Resource Linking</h2>
<p>Resource Manager has been replaced by Resource Linking.</p>
<h2>Rounded Corners</h2>
<p>When applying a border or a background color in the style editor you 
 can now set a radius so that the corners are rounded rather than square. 
 The setting is in the Border options but applies to both border and background.</p>
<h2>Special Characters</h2>
<p>The toolbar icon accesses a dialog with categories of special characters 
 to make it easier to find and insert a wide range of special characters.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/symbols.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/symbols_cats.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Spell Check</h2>
<p>Click Edit &gt; Spell Check to see the options for spell checking along 
 with their keyboard shortcuts. The spell check panel appears alongside 
 Properties.</p>
<h2>Split View</h2>
<p>Right click a tab for any topic and various split screen options will 
 be shown. That topic will be displayed top, bottom, left or right according 
 to you choice and all others will opposite. If you need more screen space, 
 hide the other panels.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/splitscreen.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Stop Words</h2>
<p>Stop Words have been moved, they are now in Output Presets. </p>
<p>Simply select a language and edit the supplied list. </p>
<p>When you generate an output, the language you choose for the output 
 will use the appropriate list.</p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
<p>Synonyms have been moved, they are now in Output Presets. </p>
<p>Synonyms are a useful way of allowing your users to enter say <span style="font-weight: bold;">car</span> and find any topic with the 
 word <span style="font-weight: bold;">automobile</span> in it.</p>
<p>Simply select a language and create your synonyms for that language. 
 </p>
<p>When you generate an output, the language you choose for the output 
 will use the appropriate list.</p>
<h2>Underscores in File Names</h2>
<p>For folders and topics in particular, it is recommended that you avoid 
 spaces in the names. In Project Settings there is now an option so that 
 underscores are automatically added if you enter a space. </p>
<p>This does not affect images to avoid issues with linked resources where 
 you cannot control the naming convention.</p>
