<h1>Outputs General</h1>
<p>Having created your topics, set up a Table of Contents, an Index, a 
 Glossary and applied condition tags to exclude certain topics and / or 
 content you are ready to generate one or more of the outputs. Let&#39;s summarize 
 the options.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> The default location for generating 
 projects has always been within the !SSL! folder. Sometimes though users 
 got it wrong and generated to the root of their project thereby trashing 
 all their source files. Some did not have a backup! To prevent this, <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> will block generating 
 to within the project files.<br/>
Instead, within My RoboHelp Projects there is now an &quot;outputs&quot; 
 folder. You can change the default in any output to your preferred location.</p>
<table class="blue" cellspacing="1" style="border-collapse:collapse;" width="100%" cellpadding="1">
	<colgroup><col style="width: 25%;"/>
	<col style="width: 75%;"/>
	</colgroup><tbody><tr>
		<td><p class="TableHeading">Type</p></td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p><a href="outputs_frameless.htm">Frameless</a></p></td>
		<td><p>Responsive HTML5 outputs still relied on frames for their 
		 structure. Frames have become less popular and this new output 
		 has skins that have no frames, it&#39;s all done with DIV tags.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p><a href="outputs_responsive.htm">Responsive HTML5</a></p></td>
		<td><p>Responsive HTML5 outputs have proved very popular as without 
		 any real work by the author, the layout adapts to the user&#39;s screen, 
		 be that a computer, a tablet or a smartphone. All the author has 
		 to do is <a href="skin_editor.htm">customise</a> the layout if 
		 required.</p>
		<p><a href="dynamic_content.htm">Dynamic Content Filtering</a> 
		 allows the author to set various filters so that the user sees 
		 just topics and content applicable to the user&#39;s choices.</p></td>

	<tr>
		<td><p><a href="outputs_webhelp.htm">WebHelp</a></p></td>
		<td><p>In the output presets it may appear that WebHelp has been 
		 dropped. It hasn&#39;t. The change is explained in <a href="outputs_webhelp.htm">WebHelp 
		 Output</a>.</p>
		<p>Dynamic User-Centric Content has been replaced by <a href="dynamic_content.htm">Dynamic 
		 Content Filtering</a>. This will require some reworking of your 
		 conditional tags but it is a better solution..</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>WebHelp Pro</p></td>
		<td><p>It&#39;s a common misunderstanding that WebHelp Pro is simply 
		 a better version of WebHelp. WebHelp Pro only worked if integrated 
		 with RoboHelp Server when it gave access to user control, reporting 
		 and other features. In <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>, 
		 when changes have been made to <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> 
		 Server, you will be able to generate the standard WebHelp output 
		 above to <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> 
		 Server. WebHelp Pro is therefore no longer required.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p><a href="outputs_mobile_apps.htm">Mobile App</a></p></td>
		<td><p>You can also create the content of your project as an app 
		 for Apple and Android devices. This can be useful in many scenarios 
		 where the user requires information but may not have guaranteed 
		 online access. Medical staff having to work in remote locations 
		 without internet access would be an example.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p><a href="outputs_chm.htm">Microsoft HTML - CHMs</a></p></td>
		<td><p>Notwithstanding its age, this format refuses to die. It 
		 is still popular where the help has to accessible offline and 
		 contained in a single file.</p>
		<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> The WebHelp to CHM Converter 
		 script is not included in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p></td>

	<tr>
		<td><p><a href="outputs_pdf.htm">PDF</a></p></td>
		<td><p>Previously the PDF format generated a Word document behind 
		 the scenes and converted that to PDF format. Now the PDF file 
		 will be created directly. You no longer need Microsoft Word installed.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p><a href="outputs_word.htm">Word</a></p></td>
		<td><p>You no longer need Microsoft Word installed. The DOCX file 
		 created can be read in any program that can read a DOCX file.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p><a href="outputs_ebook.htm">eBook</a></p></td>
		<td><p>If you create eBooks, you can use <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
		 as your editor and easily generate the topics in eBook format.</p></td>
