<h1>Mapping for Context Sensitive Help</h1>
<p>Developers can call a specific topic in the help so that users are taken 
 straight to information relating to what they are doing. This can be done 
 with a URL or by using mapping. The advantage of mapping is that you can 
 later change the file name and its location in the project structure without 
 affecting the call. The user will be presented with whatever topic you 
 have assigned to the map id.</p>
<p>The process is much cleaner in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> The window options are currently 
 only for the CHM output. WebHelp will be added later.</p>
<h2>Create a Map File</h2>
<p>To create a map file, also referred to as an H file, click Map Files 
 in Output mode. Click the + icon and give the file a name. You will then 
 see the screen shown below with the contents of the project shown. You 
 can also import H files.</p>

<p>You then drag the topics into the area shown above and they will be 
 listed in a grid as shown below. Default Map IDs and Map Numbers will 
 be applied and these can be changed to your requirements. </p>

<p>There are also some Options that you can set from the context menu.</p>

<p>You can add an automatic prefix, a start number and/or force the map 
 ids to be uppercase.</p>
