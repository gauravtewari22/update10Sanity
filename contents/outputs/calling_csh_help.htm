<h1>Calling Context Sensitive Help</h1>
<h2>Frameless Skins</h2>
<h3>Using Map IDs</h3>
<p>The call needs to be in the format - path/index.htm?rhmapno=123</p>
<p>If you require greater control over how the help opens, for example 
 to a specific window, see the RoboHelp CSH API section below.</p>
<h3>Using URLs</h3>
<p>Each topic has a unique URL and the help will open with all the navigation 
 components.</p>
<h2>Responsive Skins</h2>
<h3>Using Map IDs</h3>
<p>The call needs to be in the format - path/index.htm?rhmapno=123</p>
<p>If you require greater control over how the help opens, for example 
 to a specific window, see the RoboHelp CSH API section below.</p>
<h3>Using URLs</h3>
<p>If you use the URL of the topic in the format path/topic_name.htm, the 
 topic will open without the navigation controls, the user will have to 
 click a link to open the TOC and other controls.</p>
<p>To open the help with the navigation controls, you need a path that 
 includes the start page of the help, by default that is index.htm.</p>
<p>You then append #t= followed by the rest of the path to the required 
 topic. For example - path/index.htm#t=path/topic_name.htm</p>
<h2>WebHelp</h2>
<h3>RoboHelp 2019</h3>
<p>The difference between responsive help and webhelp is simply that latter 
 does not change as the screen is resized. In 2019 instead of using webhelp 
 skins, responsive skins are used but you can choose to disable the Responsiveness 
 option.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> This does mean your help calls 
 will need to change.</p>
<h4>Using Map IDs</h4>
<p>In Classic Versions, the format of the call was path/index.htm#&lt;id=123&gt;&gt;newwnd=false</p>
<p>For RoboHelp 2019 the format is path/index.htm?rhmapno=123</p>
<p>Thus <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">#&lt;id=123&gt;&gt;newwnd=false</span> 
 is replaced by <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #008080;">?rhmapno=123</span></p>
<h4>Using URLs</h4>
<p>The format of URLs in Classic versions was path/index.htm#path/target_topic_1.htm.</p>
<p>In RoboHelp 2019 the format is path/index.htm#t=path/topic_name.htm. 
 Note that the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #008000;">#</span> 
 symbol is followed by <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold;">t=</span>.</p>
<h2>Merged Help</h2>
<h3>Using Map IDs</h3>
<p>If you call topics using map ids, the parent and all the child projects 
 should have unique map ids in their map files. </p>
<p>If a child topic uses a map id which is same as a parent topic, then 
 using Parent/index.htm?rhmapno=123 will result in loading the parent’s 
 topic (if it exists). </p>
<p>If for some reason you cannot avoid duplication, then use the child 
 project’s own index.htm file path.</p>
<p>For example - Parent/mergedProjects/child_one/index.htm?rhmapno=123</p>
<p>If you require greater control over how the help opens, for example 
 to a specific window, see the RoboHelp CSH API section below.</p>
<h3>Using URLs</h3>
<h4>Frameless Skins</h4>
<p>Each topic has a unique URL and the help will open with all the navigation 
 components.</p>
<h4>Responsive Skins</h4>
<p>If you use the URL of the topic in the format path/topic_name.htm, the 
 topic will open without the navigation controls, the user will have to 
 click a link to open the TOC and other controls.</p>
<p>To open the help with the navigation controls, you need a path that 
 includes the start page of the help, by default that is index.htm. </p>
<p>You then append #t= followed by the rest of the path to the required 
 topic.</p>
<p>For example - path/index.htm#t=path/topic_name.htm</p>
<h2>CHMs</h2>
<p>To create CSH with CHMs (Microsoft HTML Help), use the RoboHelp CSH 
 API described below.</p>
<h3>Using Map IDs</h3>
<p>To call a topic using a map number, make a call to the HTML Help API 
 using the following syntax</p>
<p>HWND HtmlHelp(Window(), “c:\path\helpfile.chm”, HH_HELP_CONTEXT, Number);</p>
<h3>Using a File Name</h3>
<p>To call a topic using the filen name, make a call to the HTML Help API 
 using the following syntax</p>
<p>HWND HtmlHelp (Dialog(), “c:\path\helpfile.chm”, HH_DISPLAY_TOPIC, &quot;topicfile.htm&quot;);</p>
<h2>RoboHelp CSH API</h2>
<p>In C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe RoboHelp 2019\CSH API, RoboHelp provides 
 versions of this API file in a number of programming languages. Developers 
 can use this file so that it calls the help using map ids with the parameters 
 they require, such as a specific window.</p>
<h2>Creating Map IDs</h2>
<p>Creating Map IDs in RoboHelp 2019 is described in <a href="mapping.htm">Mapping</a>.</p>
