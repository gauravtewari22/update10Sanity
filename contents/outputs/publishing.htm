<h1>Publishing</h1>
<p><b>Generating</b> is about RoboHelp converting the content of your source 
 files to HTML code that can be interpreted by different browsers. Typically 
 this would be used to create an output for the author to view during development 
 but it can also be given to the developers for installation.</p>
<p><b>Publishing</b> is about the author uploading those output folders 
 and files to a web server. Typically this will be so that end users can 
 access HTML5 and WebHelp outputs from the server. With Update 5 applied, 
 the option has been added to all presets so that authors can upload the 
 output to a location required by their developers.</p>
<h2>Setting Up a Publish Location</h2>
<p>The process is the same for both responsive and webhelp outputs.</p>
<p>Click the Publish option in the Preset to see any existing locations. 
 Here there are none.</p>

<p>Click the cogwheel settings icon and select the type of profile to be 
 set up.</p>
<h3>RoboHelp Server</h3>
<p>RoboHelp Server is a separate product that can be installed on a server 
 to provide analytical tools and feedback.</p>
<p>Complete the fields as required and click Save.</p>

<h3>FTP</h3>
<p>File Transfer Protocol enables you to publish your output to any web 
 enabled server.</p>
<p>Complete the fields as required and click Save.</p>

<h3>SFTP</h3>
<p>Secure File Transfer Protocol is increasingly required to provide a 
 more secure upload.</p>
<p>Complete the fields as required and click Save.</p>

<h3>File System</h3>
<p>If the target location can be seen through File Explorer, this is the 
 simplest way to upload your output.</p>
<p>Complete the fields as required and click Save.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/publish_filesys.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Publishing</h2>
<p>Once your publish locations have been set up, they will be listed when 
 you click Publish in your preset and will be available to all your projects.</p>
<h2>Republish All</h2>
<p>Normally when you publish, <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> 
 only uploads files that have changed since the last time you published. 
 Tick Republish All if you want all the files in the output to be uploaded.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> It&#39;s important to note that 
 the process never deletes anything from the server. Topics and images 
 that are no longer part of the output have to be deleted manually.</p>
