<h1>PDF Output</h1>
<p>There are some big changes in the generation of printed documents, the 
 key one being you don&#39;t need to have Microsoft Word installed on your 
 computer. </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> In Classic versions of <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> Microsoft 
 Word was required as part of the process of creating a PDF file, that 
 is no longer a requirement.</p>
<h2>Creating a PDF Output</h2>
<p>Click Output &gt; Output Settings the first time you generate so that 
 you can configure your PDF preset as required. After the preset is configured, 
 you can either go back there next time or you can click the Quick Generate 
 icon top right in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<p>The icons above the list of presets allow you to generate an output, 
 view it or create further outputs.</p>
<p>PDF files can be created in two ways:-</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>If the PDF will not require any editing after generation, you 
	 can use the PDF preset.</p></li>
	<li><p>If you need to make any changes such as where page breaks occur, 
	 then use the <a href="outputs_word.htm">Word (DOCX) Output</a> first. 
	 After editing, you can generate your PDF from there using any PDF 
	 generator.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Preset Configuration</h2>
<p>The settings appear in five groups as below.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/print01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0" /></p>
<p>Variables can be included in the Title. Place the cursor where you want 
 the variable and press CTRL + 1.</p>
<p>The language should be set for the Table of Contents, Index and Glossary 
 page.</p>
<p>You can select a script to run after the PDF has been generated.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/print02.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Most of the options here are obvious but be aware of a change from Classic 
 versions. Previously in all versions of RoboHelp, the content has been 
 limited by design to just those topics in the print layout TOC rather 
 than all topics in the project not excluded by a condition expression 
 as in online outputs. Now all outputs are based on the TOC used so any 
 change to the TOC will also affect the print output. You can create a 
 separate print toc if required.</p>
<ul class="Tighter_Items">
	<li class="Tighter_Items"><p class="Normal-Single">Include Table of 
	 Contents sets whether or not there is a TOC in the generated document. 
	 TOC entries hidden in an online output will not be hidden in the PDF 
	 output.</p></li>
	<li class="Tighter_Items"><p class="Normal-Single">Include All Referenced 
	 Topics sets whether or not topics are not in the TOC but with links 
	 from topics in the TOC will also get included.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Classic versions of RoboHelp had an option to limit the depth of the 
 TOC in printed outputs. If you want a limited depth, set up a TOC with 
 the required number of levels.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> The cover page needs to be an 
 HTM file. If your cover page is in DOCX format, save that as a Web Page 
 in Word.</p>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>Here you have various options.</p>
<h4>Same Appearance as Online with no Header or Footer</h4>
<p>If you want the printed output to simply contain the topics using the 
 came CSS as the online help with no header or footer, leave the Master 
 Page field set to None and ignore the options on this page.</p>
<h4>Different Fonts and/or a single Header and/or Footer</h4>
<p>If you want your printed output to have different fonts and/or headers 
 and footers, you need to create at least one master page. Link the master 
 page to the required CSS and define what you want in the header/footer. 
 The header and/or footer will then be applied to all pages of your PDF 
 provided you leave the checkbox clear.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Instead of using your own master 
 page, <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 ships with an optimized PDF Master page. It is recommended that you use 
 this. If you want different odd and even master pages, create a copy and 
 name the pages to differentiate them.<br/>
If your project was created before Update 6 was released, create a new 
 project and copy the PDF master page and CSS from there into your project.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/print03.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>The PDF master page is associated with a supplied pdf.css file to give 
 you more control over the appearance. Double click the CSS file to open 
 it in the editor where you will find many styles that you can edit to 
 meet your own requirements. The appearance of the TOC can be defined up 
 to six levels.</p>
<p>Use of this CSS is recommended but you can copy the styles to your own 
 CSS if required. </p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/pdf_css.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h4>Multiple Headers and/or Footers</h4>
<p>If you want different pages to have different headers and/or footers, 
 then tick the checkbox. That will reveal the additional fields shown below 
 with the Topics fields displayed.</p>
<p>If you are using the supplied PDF master page, it is suggested that 
 you create copies of that and amend them as required.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/print04.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h5>Topics - First Page</h5>
<p>Leave as None or select the master page to be used for the first page 
 of the topic section. </p>
<p>If the same master page is to be used for all topics, tick the Apply 
 To All Topics Pages checkbox. The Even Pages and Odd Pages fields will 
 then be hidden.</p>
<h5>Topics - Even Pages and Odd Pages</h5>
<p>If different master pages are to be set for Even Pages and Odd Pages, 
 leave the checkbox clear and select the required master pages.</p>
<h5>TOC / Index and Glossary Sections</h5>
<p>You can either click the Apply To All Sections button to apply the same 
 settings to the other sections or you can click the dropdowns for each 
 and apply the required settings.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>Here you set up the page settings. Click the link icon if you want to 
 apply different top, bottom, left or right margins.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/print05.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>The Limit TOC Depth field is now controlled by the TOC that you associate 
 with the PDF.</p>
<h3>Publish</h3>
<p>You can create a Publish Location for this output. Typically that will 
 be used to deliver it to developers. How this is set up is described in 
 <a href="publishing.htm">Publishing</a>.</p>
<h2>Generating the Output</h2>
<p>Once you have defined the preset, click the generate icon.</p>
<div data-conref="../assets/snippets/Cancel Generation.hts"></div>
<h2>Viewing the Output</h2>
<p>Click the view icon on the Output Presets toolbar. <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> can create a 
 PDF but it does not install a reader unless it is part of Adobe&#39;s Technical 
 Communication Suite. If you don&#39;t have a reader installed, you will need 
 to download one.</p>
