<h1>WebHelp Output</h1>
<p>At first sight it may appear WebHelp has been dropped in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/presets.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>It hasn&#39;t! The difference between webhelp and responsive help is simply 
 that webhelp does not adapt to the size of the user&#39;s screen whereas responsive 
 help does. <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 has the same skins for both webhelp and responsive help but if you want 
 your users to always have the same appearance no matter what their screen 
 size, you can simply turn off responsiveness.</p>

<h2>Dynamic User-Centric Content</h2>
<p>Dynamic User-Centric Content is no longer supported other than in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> Classic. Instead 
 <a href="dynamic_content.htm">Dynamic Content Filtering</a> has been added 
 to WebHelp. It will require some reworking but it is a better format with 
 more options.</p>
<h2>The WebHelp to CHM Converter Script</h2>
<p>This is not supported in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 other than in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 Classic.</p>
