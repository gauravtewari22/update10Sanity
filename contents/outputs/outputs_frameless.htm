<h1>Frameless Output</h1>
<p><span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 introduces truly frameless outputs, no iFrames at all.</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p>iFrames limited how Google indexing and search worked for online 
	 help, the frameless skin will result in improvements there.</p></li>
	<li><p>Each topic has a unique simpler URL</p></li>
	<li><p>The skin editor allows significantly more customization.</p></li>
	<li><p>You can choose to have a Home Page, No Home Page (goes to default 
	 topic) or a Home Page with the default topic as well.</p></li>
	<li><p>Mini TOC built in.</p></li>
	<li><p>Advanced users will be able to modify these skins outside of 
	 the skin editor or create their own skins as they could in Classic 
	 versions. Such editing and creation is done outside of RoboHelp using 
	 other HTML editors such as Adobe Dreamweaver. Skins edited or created 
	 this way are not supported for further editing in the skin editor.</p></li>
	<li><p>Frameless skins are GDPR compliant. Users will have the option 
	 to accept or reject the writing of the cookie that records acceptance.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Show Me</h2>
<h3>Home Page Only</h3>
<p>The home page shows icons to access the top level books in the table 
 of contents.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/orange01.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>All the books above are shown with the default images. You can change 
 that in the skin editor. In the Layout Page tab go to TOC Tile Images 
 to set your default images. If you set just two images, the images will 
 be applied to every other book. If you set three or more, they will be 
 applied in series.</p>
<p>In the TOC editor you can apply different images to each book or page, 
 just click the book or page and select Properties.</p>
<p>In the skin editor you can set your image to cover the whole area and 
 have the text sit on top of the image. In the skin editor Home Page tab, 
 set the background opacity for tile-details-box to zero and the font color 
 to whatever you require. The font color for the number of articles is 
 set in tile-topics-count. Note that the settings in the skin editor will 
 apply to all the books.</p>
<h3>No Home Page</h3>
<p>This will open with the default topic displayed and work more like traditional 
 help. Note though, no frames! It&#39;s all done with DIV tags.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/frameless_02.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h3>Home Page and Default Topic</h3>
<p>This is simply the home page you see in the first image with your default 
 topic below it.</p>
<h2>Editing Frameless Skins</h2>
<p>The frameless skin editor has many more options than ever before and 
 you will likely find you can create whatever you want by digging into 
 the editing tabs. As you drill down through the various options, the image 
 will be highlighted to show the area you are working on.</p>
<h3>The Layout Tab</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/frameless_03.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_Only" border="0"/></p>
<h3>The Home Page Tab</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/frameless_04.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h3>The Topic Page Tab</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/frameless_05.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<h3>The Options</h3>
<p>There are more options than ever before and it is beyond the scope of 
 this sample project to cover them all.</p>
<h4>Some Highlights</h4>
<ul class="Standard_Bullet">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet">All the text can be set to your preferred 
	 fonts, weights and colors.</li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet">Colors and images can all be changed.</li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet">The size of different areas can be set 
	 as required.</li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet">Borders can be set to whatever width you 
	 want and have square or round corners.</li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet">The skins have a Download PDF button. In 
	 the preset layout tab you can define the path enabling users to download 
	 a PDF of the help. If you don&#39;t want to use that option, delete the 
	 button from the skin.</li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet">The skin is created from the DIVs defined 
	 in the EJS and the supporting CSS files. Expert users can edit those 
	 as well but the skin editor should cover most requirements.</li>
</ul>
