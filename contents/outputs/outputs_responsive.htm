<h1>Responsive HTML5 Output</h1>
<p>Responsive HTML5 outputs have proved very popular as with little input 
 from the author, the layout adapts to the user&#39;s screen, be that a computer, 
 a tablet or a smartphone. All the author has to do is <a href="skin_editor.htm">customise</a> 
 the layout if required.</p>
<h2>Creating a Responsive HTML5 Layout</h2>
<p>Click Output &gt; Output Settings the first time you generate so that 
 you can configure your preset as required. After the preset is configured, 
 you can either come back here next time or you can click the Quick Generate 
 icon top right in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<p>The options are similar to previous versions and are described in detail 
 in the online help. Variables can be included in the Title. Place the 
 cursor where you want the variable and press CTRL + 1.</p>
<p>The icons above the list of presets allow you to generate an output, 
 view it or create further outputs.<br/>
