<h1>The Skin Editor</h1>
<p>The skin editor now allows changes to all skins.</p>
<p>There is also a change in terminology. </p>
<ul class="Standard_Bullet">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>Previously, for Responsive HTML5 help, 
	 the design was referred to as the layout. There were also problems 
	 when the functionality needed to be changed that resulted in the loss 
	 of customization.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>Now &quot;layout&quot; will refer to 
	 the structure and &quot;skin&quot; will refer to the appearance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The changes mean the terminology for both outputs is now the same and 
 Adobe can change the underpinning code of the layout without any loss 
 of customization.</p>
<p>Click Output &gt; Output Settings and then click Skins. When you select 
 what you want to edit, a preview will display on the right along with 
 the Skin Components you can customize. As you click each component, its 
 properties will be displayed on the left of the preview for editing.</p>
<p>Because the Logo setting has focus, the preview on the right has a red 
 square showing what will be affected by any changes made.</p>

<h2>Customized Skins</h2>
<p>When you upgrade from a Classic version of <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>, 
 the Indigo skin will include any customization provided it was customized 
 using the Classic skin editor. Editing done outside the Classic skin editor 
 will not get upgraded.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Customization of other skins 
 will need to be reapplied in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<p>If your skin has been customized outside the <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> 
 Classic skin editor in an earlier version, after upgrading you can import 
 your skin from your Classic project. In the Import dialog make sure you 
 click the Keep Using Older Layout of the Skin check box.</p>
<h2>Duplicate Skins</h2>
<p>You might want to make some changes to a skin either because corporate 
 branding is about to change or you just feel that some tweaks are needed. 
 You don&#39;t want to play with the current skin though until the new one 
 is ready. With Update 5 applied, you can now create a duplicate and work 
 on that.</p>
<p>When the changes are complete, if required you can export the layout 
 to other projects.</p>
<p>Both options are in the context menu.</p>
<h2>Frameless Skins</h2>
<p>Whilst the editor for frameless skins works in a similar way to other 
 skins, there are differences as well as significantly more options. See 
 <a href="outputs_frameless.htm">Frameless Outputs</a> for the details.</p>
<h2>508 Compliance</h2>
<p>With Update 6 applied, all the skins are 508 compliant with the exception 
 of Coffee. That will be made compliant later.</p>
<p>There are two elements to what is generally referred to as a &quot;skin&quot;. 
 The layout, which is the underlying structure and functionality, and the 
 skin, the appearance.</p>
<ul class="Standard_Bullet">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>If your project was created <span style="font-weight: bold;">after</span> 
	 applying Update 6, the supplied skins and their underlying layouts 
	 are 508 compliant, with the exception of the Coffee skin.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>If your project was created <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> 
	 Update 6 or is a project upgraded from any Classic version of RoboHelp 
	 and 508 compliance is required, the safest option is to select the 
	 required skin afresh. </p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> If in doubt, it is recommended 
 that you select a skin after applying Update 6. <br/>
Go to Output &gt; Skins and click the + icon and select the required skin. 
 You will then be able to select that skin in Output Presets &gt; Layout 
 &gt; Skin<br/>
OR<br/>
In Output Presets &gt; Layout &gt; Skin click the browse icon <img src="../assets/images/images/browse_icon.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> and select the required 
 skin.<br/>
If the project already has a skin with the same name, it will be necessary 
 to use a slightly different name to differentiate it, perhaps just append 
 &quot;508_Compliant&quot;.</p>
<p class="Spacer"> </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Customization 
 and 508 Compliance</span><br/>
It is only the supplied layout and skin that are 508 compliant. If you 
 apply any customization to the skin, then you must ensure that too is 
 compliant. Your customization could break that if, for example, you define 
 colors that do not have the necessary contrast. You must also ensure that 
 your content is 508 compliant.</p>
