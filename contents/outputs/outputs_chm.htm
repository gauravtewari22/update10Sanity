<h1>Microsoft HTML Output - CHM</h1>
<p>Notwithstanding its age, this format refuses to die. It is still popular 
 where the help has to accessible offline and contained in a single file.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> CHM files do not understand 
 CSS3 standards so a copy of the css used is converted to CSS2 on the fly. 
 This may mean the output is not exactly as designed.</p>
<h2>Creating a CHM</h2>
<p>Click Output &gt; Output Settings the first time you generate so that 
 you can configure your preset as required. After the preset is configured, 
 you can either come back here next time or you can click the Quick Generate 
 icon top right in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<p>The options are similar to previous versions and are described in detail 
 in the online help. Variables can be included in the Title. Place the 
 cursor where you want the variable and press CTRL + 1.</p>
<p>The icons above the list of presets allow you to generate an output, 
 view it or create further outputs.<br/>

<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Whilst you can create a Publish 
 Location for this output, CHM files cannot be run from a server and this 
 option should not be used for that purpose. Typically it will be used 
 to deliver it to developers. How this is set up is described in <a href="publishing.htm">Publishing</a>.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>To create or edit the window for Microsoft HTML Help (CHMs), click Outputs 
 and select Window Settings.</p>
<p>Existing windows will be listed and you can create new ones by clicking 
 the + icon.</p>
<p>Double click a window shown in the Project Component Panel to edit it 
 or hover over it and click the menu icon that will be displayed.</p>
<p>You will then see the various settings that can be applied. Please refer 
 to the <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> 
 online help for details.<img src="../assets/images/images/window_chm.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_and_Bottom" border="0"/></p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> If you also create other help 
 outputs and your developers use an API with a window defined, settings 
 for other outputs will be added later.</p>
