<h1>Word Output</h1>
<p>There are some big changes in the generation of printed documents, the 
 key one being you don&#39;t need to have Microsoft Word installed on your 
 computer. The DOCX file created does not use any of the proprietary features 
 of Microsoft Word meaning it can be read in any program that can read 
 a DOCX file.</p>
<h2>Creating a Word Output</h2>
<p>Click Output &gt; Output Settings the first time you generate so that 
 you can configure your Word preset as required. After the preset is configured, 
 you can either go back there next time or you can click the Quick Generate 
 icon top right in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<p>The icons above the list of presets allow you to generate an output, 
 view it or create further outputs.</p>
<h2>Preset Configuration</h2>
<p>The settings appear in five groups as below.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/word_preset_01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Variables can be included in the Title. Place the cursor where you want 
 the variable and press CTRL + 1.</p>
<p>The language should be set for the Table of Contents, Index and Glossary 
 page.</p>
<p>You can select a script to run after the document has been generated.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/word_preset_02.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>Most of the options here are obvious but be aware of a change from Classic 
 versions. Previously in all versions of RoboHelp, the content has been 
 limited by design to just those topics in the print layout TOC rather 
 than all topics in the project not excluded by a condition expression 
 as in online outputs. Now all outputs are based on the TOC used so any 
 change to the TOC will also affect the print output. You can create a 
 separate print toc if required.</p>
<ul class="Tighter_Items">
	<li class="Tighter_Items"><p class="Normal-Single">Include Table of 
	 Contents sets whether or not there is a TOC in the generated document. 
	 TOC entries hidden in an online output will not be hidden in the Word 
	 output.</p></li>
	<li class="Tighter_Items"><p class="Normal-Single">Include All Referenced 
	 Topics sets whether or not topics are not in the TOC but with links 
	 from topics in the TOC will also get included.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Classic versions of RoboHelp had an option to limit the depth of the 
 TOC in printed outputs. If you want a limited depth, set up a TOC with 
 the required number of levels.</p>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/word_preset_03.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/></p>
<p>Here you can apply a Master Page to your document. See Style Hierarchy 
 and Headers and Footers below for information on how that will affect 
 your document.</p>
<h3>Word</h3>
<p><img src="../assets/images/images/word_preset_04.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Bottom_Only" border="0"/></p>
<p>Here you can apply a Master Page to your document. </p>
<p>What you see under In Word Output will depend on whether you have selected 
 a Master Page and/or a Word Template or left both blank.</p>
<p>See Style Hierarchy and Headers and Footers below for information on 
 how that will affect your document.</p>
<h3>Publish</h3>
<p>You can create a Publish Location for this output. Typically that will 
 be used to deliver it to developers. How this is set up is described in 
 <a href="publishing.htm">Publishing</a>.</p>
<h2>Style Hierarchy and Headers and Footers</h2>
<h4>Project uses one CSS file that you want for the printed output.</h4>
<p>Leave the Master Page and Word template fields blank. The project CSS 
 styles will be in the Style Mapping options. If you want headers and footers, 
 then you must use a Word template with the required header and footer 
 set up. Under Style Mapping the default will mapped to the Word template 
 style if that style is part of the template. You can change that to the 
 style from the CSS.</p>
<h4>Project uses multiple CSS files.</h4>
<p>If the topics are not all using the same CSS and if no master page and 
 no template is selected in the Word settings, the CSS files will be merged 
 and will follow cascading rules. Thus if the first CSS states that H1 
 is a red font at 24pt and second states H1 is a blue font at 24pt and 
 the third states it is a green font at 18pt italic, the document H1 style 
 will be green 18pt italic.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> As this can be unpredictable, 
 it is recommended that where multiple CSS files are used in the various 
 topics, that you either use a Master Page with a linked CSS file or a 
 Word template.</p>
<h4>Project uses one CSS file but you want different styles in the printed 
 output.</h4>
<p>You can use a master page with a CSS file attached and/or you can use 
 a Word template.</p>
<h5>Master Pages</h5>
<p>Using a master page you can quickly change the styles by taking your 
 topic CSS and creating a print version, mystyles_print.css for example. 
 You can then quickly redefine the styles as required.</p>
<p>You can use existing master pages. Note that any headers and footers 
 in them will not appear in the output.</p>
<h5>Word Templates</h5>
<p>A Word template is required if the printed output is to have headers 
 and footers. </p>
<p>The template can be set up to have all the styles you require and in 
 Style Mapping, <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 will default to what is in the template if there is a matching style. 
 You can change that to the CSS style. </p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> If you are using a template 
 solely to get headers and footers, create a new template to minimise the 
 number of default styles in it.</p>
<h4>Style Mapping</h4>
<p>Under Style Mapping, you will see how <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 has mapped topics and you can change that as required. </p>
<h2>Generating the Output</h2>
<p>Once you have defined the preset, click the generate icon.</p>
<div data-conref="../assets/snippets/Cancel Generation.hts"></div>
<h2>Viewing the Output</h2>
<p>Click the view icon on the Output Presets toolbar. The document 
 will open in whichever program has been associated with the DOCX format.</p>
