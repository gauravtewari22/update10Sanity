<h1>Adobe RoboHelp Reimagined</h1>
<p class="Emphasis1">This sample project describes the new version of <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> with Update 
 10 applied. If what you see here differs from what you see in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>, check Help &gt; 
 Updates to ensure you have applied the update. <span data-condition="Others:Online_Only">Use 
 the browse sequence icon top right to walk through how to use the features. 
 </span>Options shown in some of the images may have detail changes 
 as updates are released.</p>
<p>Since Adobe acquired RoboHelp, there have been some great new features 
 added. <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 is a complete rewrite with a reimagined user interface using modern design 
 paradigms. <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt;">This 
 enables new features and fixes to be developed much more rapidly and</span> 
 <span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">demonstrates Adobe&#39;s commitment to 
 this major authoring tool.</span> </p>
<p>Existing users will recognise <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 as having a much more modern look and feel and, along with new users, 
 they will see something that is easy to work with.</p>
<h2>New User Interface</h2>
<p>The UI is very different. It&#39;s all explained in <a href="../working_with_rh/ui.htm">User 
 Interface</a> and Creating Topics in the Table of Contents.</p>
<p class="Caption"><img src="../assets/images/images/ui_01.png" alt="" class="Spacing_None" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Contents Panel shows what is in File Explorer</h2>
<p>You can still import images and other files but now that&#39;s not the only 
 way. You can add folders and files using File Explorer and they will show 
 in the Contents above.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Beware of renaming folders and 
 files in File Explorer as that can still break links in RoboHelp.</p>
<h2>HTML5 and CSS3 Supported</h2>
<p>The new editor supports both HTML5 and CSS3. Previously HTML5 outputs 
 were generated from HTML4 code in the source topics.</p>
<h2>SVG, WebP and Font Awesome</h2>
<p>These image formats are supported in <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<h2>New Skin Editor</h2>
<p>The skin editor now allows changes to all skins.</p>
<p>There is also a change in terminology. </p>
<ul class="Standard_Bullet">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>Previously, for Responsive HTML5 help, 
	 the design was referred to as the layout. There were also problems 
	 when the functionality needed to be changed that resulted in the loss 
	 of customization.</p></li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet"><p>Now &quot;layout&quot; will refer to 
	 the structure and &quot;skin&quot; will refer to the appearance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The changes mean Adobe can change the underpinning code of the layout 
 without any loss of customization.</p>
<h2>Resource Linking</h2>
<p>Resource Manager has been replaced by Resource Linking.</p>
<h2>Source Control</h2>
<p><a href="../authoring/source_control.htm">Source Control</a> is supported. 
 The topic links to a list of the source controls supported.</p>
<h2>Multi Author</h2>
<p>In <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> 
 more than one author can work on a project without source control. This 
 does not allow different authors to work on the same topic or for different 
 authors to work simultaneously on the same feature, such as the TOC. Use 
 with care.</p>
<p>This can be done across a network or using cloud based projects.</p>
<p class="Emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"/> Always backup the project before 
 you start multi-authoring this way.</p>
<h2>RoboScreen Capture</h2>
<p>RoboScreen Capture will be installed but it will not be directly accessible 
 from <span data-keyref="ProdName">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span>.</p>
<p>Open it from Windows &gt; Start.</p>
<h2>Baggage Files Simplified</h2>
<p>Add the file in the Contents Panel and then add it to the TOC. If you 
 don&#39;t want users to see it in the TOC, tick Hide in Output in the Properties 
 Panel.</p>
<h2>Emails</h2>
<p>You can now create links to a draft email that users can click in topics 
 or the Table of Contents to create an email in their default email program. 
 </p>
<h2>Microsoft Word Not Required</h2>
<p>No more issues with having a compatible version of Word installed. You 
 do not need any version of Word installed. </p>
<ul class="Standard_Bullet">
	<li class="Standard_Bullet">Adobe RoboHelp 2019 will import and link 
	 to any DOCX file without Microsoft Word being installed.</li>
	<li class="Standard_Bullet">For Printed Documentation you can create 
	 a PDF or DOCX output without Microsoft Word being installed.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
